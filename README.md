# Wordpress Child Theme for Lernorte für MorGEN

This is the child theme for the Lernorte für MorGEN website, a project by [GEN Deutschland](https://gen-deutschland.de).

It serves a very specific usecase, but feel free to get inspired, give feedback or get in contact.

It is currently based off a random theme ([Greatmag, version 1.04](https://athemes.com/theme/greatmag/)), no design-decisions were made yet.

## Installation

  * Install the pods, [github-updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) and leaflet-map plugins.
  * Use [github-updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) and provide `https://github.com/gen-germany/lernorte-fuer-morgen-childtheme` as the URL.

## Gotchas

As pods are used, and field labels are not yet easily translated (need WPML Pro or serious hacking), model and field names are German - horrible for a developer, but its a tradeoff that had to be done.

## Implemented Features

Most real functionality will eventually end in a WordPress-Plugin.

  * made available with [github-updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater)
  * provide a map partial template to display all addresses of `Kooperationspartner` Custom Post Types
